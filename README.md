## Getting Started
This is a template for a Rust project that uses [Hydroflow+](http://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow) for distributed services. To generate a project, run 

```bash
$ cargo install cargo-generate
$ cargo generate hydro-project/hydroflow-plus-template
```

Once the command completes, you can cd into the project and test the template.
```bash
$ cd <myproject>
$ cargo test
```
